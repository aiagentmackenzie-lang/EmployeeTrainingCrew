### Core Concepts of CrewAI

1. **Agents**:
   - Autonomous units programmed to perform tasks, make decisions, and communicate with each other.
   - Each agent has defined roles, goals, and backstories that guide their actions.
   - Examples of agent roles include Researcher, Writer, Customer Support, etc.

2. **Tasks**:
   - Specific objectives assigned to agents, which can range from simple operations to complex problem-solving activities.
   - Tasks are executed asynchronously, allowing agents to work efficiently.

3. **Tools**:
   - Agents can utilize specialized tools to perform their tasks effectively.
   - Tools can range from web search engines to data analysis software.

4. **Processes**:
   - Structured workflows that agents follow to complete their tasks.
   - Processes can incorporate memory, allowing agents to remember previous interactions and outcomes.

5. **Crews**:
   - A group of agents collaborating towards a common goal.
   - Crews can consist of various agents with different roles, working together to enhance overall productivity.
